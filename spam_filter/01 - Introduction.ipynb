    "The overall purpose of my project analysis is to build a spam classifier that will be able to predict whether an email is spam or not. The problem at hand is how to determine whether an email is spam based solely on its contents. To tackle this problem, I build a dataset consisting of all of the relevant attributes from every email. I began with all of the relevant attributes which weren't the subject-line or the main message. Then, I used a natural language processor to analyze the subject-line and main message to further gather insights. With all of this critical information included in my dataset, I then built a model to predict whether an email is spam or not."

    "The data set I am using consists of around 4,500 emails in .eml format, meaning they contain all of the attributes of any particular email. This means that they contain more than just the subject-line, main message, and from attributes. Generally, this data is very messy and needs a lot of cleaning. "
